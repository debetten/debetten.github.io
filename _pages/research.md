## Current Work
I am currently a Senior Research Scientist at [Ruby Neurotech](https://www.ruby-neurotech.com/), an early-stage startup funded by [Wellcome Leap](https://wellcomeleap.org/) to build AI-powered mental health solutions. Our work integrates AI and neurophysiology to deliver individualized interventions at scale. 

A few things that I've been working on are designing human-AI conversations as well as large-scale evaluation of human-AI interactions, and identifying biomarkers that can predict the success of our interventions by integrating qualitative diaries, behavioral patterns, and physiological time-series signals of pupil size.

I also recently consulted on a Stanford University project, funded by the [Wu Tsai Human Performance Alliance](https://humanperformancealliance.org/), focused on enhancing cognitive performance through real-time eye tracking. In this role, I provided guidance on developing a closed-loop system that monitors attention in real time and improves memory. <br><br>

## Past Research
Previously, I was a post-doctoral fellow at UChicago (supported by NIH K99 & F32 awards) and a Neuroscience PhD student at Princeton University (supported by an NSF GRFP). My research focused on developing brain-computer interfaces to improve attention and memory. I collaborated with Intel Labs' Brain-Inspired Computing group and clinical researchers at UT Austin, UPenn, and neurologists and neurosurgeons at the UChicago Medical Center. Two key technologies that I developed were real-time fMRI neurofeedback and real-time triggering, which I used to explore the dynamics of attention and memory. I have extensive experience with a wide range of complementary cognitive neuroscience techniques, including EEG, fMRI, fNIRS, intracranial recordings, eye-tracking, pupillometry, face and pose tracking, PPG, heart rate variability, and both qualitative and quantitative asssessments of human behavior.

I hold a BS in Applied Mathematics from Columbia University, where I spent significant time as an undergraduate researcher in the Biomedical and Electrical Engineering departments building ML analysis and signal processing tools for EEG and fMRI.
