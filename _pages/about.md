## About Me


The central theme of my work is developing technologies that support and enhance human behavior. Through my research that spans tech and academia, I have identified how imperfect human cognition is --- our attention constantly lapses and we forget much (if not most) of what we see and experience. To address this, I have been building closed-loop interventions that not only track cognitive dynamics in real time but also find ways to augment and improve what we pay attention to, what we learn about, and what we remember. This neuroadaptive approach is valuable for tools we all use in everyday life and especially relevant for health-related applications. Most recently, I have focused on leveraging AI and machine learning, combining physiological data with insights from cognitive psychology, to create scalable, personalized, and adaptive cognitive interfaces. <br><br>

I have [authored 20+ articles in peer-reveiwed journals](/publications), including *Nature Neuroscience* and *Nature Human Behaviour*. My work has been featured in [The NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/10/science/training-the-mind-not-to-wander.html) and [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/02/the-attention-machine/385284/). <br><br>

My work spans the intersection of neurotechnology, AI, and cognitive science. I am currently a Senior Research Scientist at Ruby Neurotech. I earned my PhD in Neuroscience from Princeton University (supported by an NSF GRFP) and then was a post-doctoral fellow at UChicago (supported by NIH K99 and F32 awards). Before graduate school, I studied Applied Mathematics at Columbia University.
