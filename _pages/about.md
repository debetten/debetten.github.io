## About Me


The central theme of my work is developing computationally sophisticated analyses to understand human cognition, behavior, and physiology. Through my research that spans tech and academia, I have identified how imperfect human cognition is --- our attention constantly lapses and we forget much (if not most) of what we see and experience. I have used machine learning tools to diagnose these lapses and memory failures from complex, multimodal data and have led human research studies to design interventions that apply these insights at scale. In particular, I build closed-loop human-AI interventions that use real-time biosensing technologies to find ways to augment and improve human cognition, what we pay attention to, what we learn about, and what we remember. Most recently, I have focused on leveraging AI and machine learning, combining physiological data with insights from cognitive psychology, to create scalable, personalized, and adaptive cognitive interfaces. This neuroadaptive approach is valuable for everyday technologies and especially impactful in health-related applications. <br>

I have [authored 20+ articles in peer-reveiwed journals](/publications), including *Nature Neuroscience* and *Nature Human Behaviour*. My work has been featured in [The NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/10/science/training-the-mind-not-to-wander.html) and [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/02/the-attention-machine/385284/). <br>

My work spans the intersection of engineering, AI, neurotechnology and cognitive science. I am currently a Senior Research Scientist at Ruby Neurotech. I earned my PhD in Neuroscience from Princeton University (supported by an NSF GRFP and funding from Intel Labs) and then was a post-doctoral fellow at UChicago (supported by NIH K99 and F32 postdoctoral awards). Before graduate school, I studied Applied Mathematics at Columbia University.
