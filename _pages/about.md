**About**

I am currently a Research Scientist at Ruby Neurotech, building brain-computer interfaces for mental health, funded by [Wellcome Leap](https://wellcomeleap.org/). I'm also a consultant for a project at Stanford University, funded by [Wu Tsai Human Performance Alliance](https://humanperformancealliance.org/). 


Previously, I was a [K99 Brain Initiative](https://braininitiative.nih.gov/megan-debettencourt-phd) post-doc at the [Institute for Mind and Biology](http://imb.uchicago.edu/) and the [Department of Psychology](http://psychology.uchicago.edu/) at the [University of Chicago](http://www.uchicago.edu/), working with [Ed Awh and Ed Vogel](http://awhvogellab.com/).


I completed my PhD in the [Princeton Neuroscience Institute](http://www.princeton.edu/neuroscience/) at [Princeton University](http://www.princeton.edu/), working with [Ken Norman](http://compmem.princeton.edu/) and [Nick Turk-Browne](http://ntblab.yale.edu/).


**Research**

The goal of my research is to develop technologies that can augment and improve human behavior, using brain-computer interfaces, machine learning, and data analysis in conjunction with multimodal neural and biological recordings. For example, I built real-time platforms to monitor attention lapses and deliver closed-loop neurofeedback and state-dependent triggering. I have expertise in neuroscience, engineering, and human psychology, and experience with academic-industry partnerships.
