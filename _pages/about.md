## About Me


I am a scientist and researcher with over a decade of experience developing innovative technologies to enhance human cognition and perception.  

My work spans the intersection of neurotechnology, AI, and cognitive science. I specialize in data analysis and end-to-end experimental design (including ML, LLMs, statistical modeling, qualitative & quantitative methods). I also have experience collaborating with diverse teams, including software engineers and clinicians, to close the loop between technology, research, and real-world applications. One of my primary areas of interest and expertise is in creating real-time, personalized, and adaptive systems. <br><br>

## Current Work
Currently, I am a Senior Research Scientist at [Ruby Neurotech](https://www.ruby-neurotech.com/), an early-stage startup funded by [Wellcome Leap](https://wellcomeleap.org/) to build AI-powered mental health solutions. Our work integrates AI and neurophysiology to deliver scalable and individualized interventions. <br><br>

I recently consulted on a Stanford University project funded by the [Wu Tsai Human Performance Alliance](https://humanperformancealliance.org/), focused on enhancing cognitive performance through real-time eye tracking. I provided guidance on how to develop a closed-loop system that monitors attention in real time and improves memory. <br><br>

## Past Research
Previously, I was a post-doctoral fellow at UChicago (supported by NIH K99 & F32 awards) and a Neuroscience PhD student at Princeton University (on an NSF GRFP). My research focused on developing brain-computer interfaces for cognition, including real-time triggering and closed-loop neurofeedback, to improve attention, learning, and memory. I collaborated with Intel Labs' Brain-Inspired Computing group and clinical researchers at UT Austin, UPenn, and UChicago Medical Center. Two key technologies that I developed were real-time fMRI and real-time triggering, which I used to explore the real-time dynamics of attention and memory. <br><br>

I hold a BS in Applied Mathematics from Columbia University, where I spent significant time as an undergraduate researcher in the Biomedical and Electrical Engineering departments.
