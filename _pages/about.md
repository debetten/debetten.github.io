## About Me

I am a scientist and researcher with over a decade of experience applying AI and machine learning to better understand and enhance human cognition, health, and behavior. Combining my background in engineering and cognitive neuroscience, I have identified how imperfect human cognition is --- our attention constantly lapses and we forget much (if not most) of what we see and experience. I develop machine learning pipelines that analyze complex, multimodal time-series data — including gaze tracking, pupillometry, and neural signals and and use large language models to build AI tools that support meaningful human-AI interactions. Through my research that spans tech and academia, I create real-time, closed-loop systems that help optimize what we pay attention to, how we learn, and what we remember.
<br>

I have [authored 20+ articles in peer-reveiwed journals](/publications), including *Nature Neuroscience* and *Nature Human Behaviour*. My work has been featured in [The NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/10/science/training-the-mind-not-to-wander.html) and [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/02/the-attention-machine/385284/). <br>

My work spans the intersection of quantitative research, AI/ML, engineering, neurotechnology and cognitive science. I am currently a Senior Quantitative UX Researcher at Google. I earned my PhD in Neuroscience from Princeton University (supported by an NSF GRFP and funding from Intel Labs) and then was a post-doctoral fellow at UChicago (supported by NIH K99 and F32 postdoctoral awards). Before graduate school, I studied Applied Mathematics at Columbia University.
